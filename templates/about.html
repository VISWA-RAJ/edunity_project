      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        EDUnity was born from a simple idea: to create a single, unified digital space for students to connect, collaborate, and thrive. We noticed that essential campus activities—from sharing study notes and clarifying doubts to finding lost items and staying updated with notices—were scattered across countless disconnected platforms. Our mission is to bring all of these functionalities under one roof, creating an integrated and seamless experience for every student.

      <h2>What is Gamification?</h2>
      <p>
        At the heart of EDUnity is a powerful gamification engine. We believe that contributing to the campus community should be rewarding. That's why every positive action you take on the platform, from uploading helpful notes to answering a fellow student's doubt or setting a high score in a game, earns you EDUnity points. These points increase your rank on the main leaderboard, showcasing your impact and dedication to making our campus a better place for everyone.

      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p>
        This platform was designed and developed with the modern student in mind. We aim to foster a stronger sense of community, make academic life more efficient, and add a layer of fun to the daily campus grind. EDUnity is more than just a utility; it's a digital reflection of our vibrant and dynamic campus life.
